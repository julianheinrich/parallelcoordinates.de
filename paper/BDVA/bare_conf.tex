% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{./figs/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{hyperref} % Works better than url
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

In many contexts we find the need to explore large and complex data sets with respect to data points as well as number of variables.
A technique, well known in the visualization community, for exploring high variate data sets is Parallel Coordinates~\cite{inselberg_parallel_2009}.
Parallel coordinates visualizes many variables at the same time by drawing an axis for each variable parallel to each other.
A single data point is represented by a line which crosses each axis at the value the data point selects for the variable represented by the axis.
Outside the visualization community however, it seems not so widely used, despite its straight forward usage.

In this exposition we present a web-based implementation to make it accessible to and usable for a wide audience.
This implementation also demonstrates the core functionality of parallel coordinates.
It supports large data in terms of data points by providing progressive rendering and density based rendering features.
Furthermore it shows how parallel coordinates can be extended by advanced analytics by connecting it to the R statistical computing environment through OpenCPU\cite{OpenCPU}.
This is a work in progress which serves as demonstration for potential implementation of more targeted applications.
It can be accessed on-line at:

\subsection{OpenCPU}

\section{Analytics}

Visual analytics has been defined as the ``combination of automated analysis techniques with interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex data sets'' \cite{Keim2010}. % book: solving problems with visual analytics
To this end we demonstrate how to combine a parallel coordinates visualization with R.
R is both a language and an environment for statistical computing\cite{R_project}. %http://www.r-project.org/about.html
It is widely used in a variety of domains, among which bioinformatics is a prominent one.
Combining parallel coordinates, therefore brings a wide range of analytical approaches.

OpenCPU is a system which makes R packages available through an HTTP API.
For example, in our demo application we provde a clustering function, which is accessed by sending an HTTP POST request to:
\url{http//public.opencpu.org/ocpu/github/bbroeksema/pacode/R/pacode.kmeans}.
Arguments to a function are transmitted in the post body in json format.
As a response on calling such a function, OpenCPU sends back a session object.
This object can either be used to get the actual function output in a variety of formats, amongst which json.
Or, it can be used to chain functions, by passing a session key as arguments to another function call.
Most of the low-level complexity of sending requests and retrieving results is taken away by the additional light-weight OpenCPU JavaScript library.

OpenCPU can be run from within R, however a more scalable approach is running the dedicated OpenCPU server.
OpenCPU server, which can be installed on Linux servers provides caching.
The caching mechanism assumes the functions in an R package to be pure functions, i.e. they have no side-effects.
This allows for caching arguments and results, avoiding recalculation of results when the arguments to a function are the same as an earlier call.
Further scalability when using OpenCPU can be achieved by writing the R code using the SparkR package.
The SparkR package provides a front-end to Apache Spark, which in turn is a large-scale data processing engine allowing for distributed computing on clusters.

\subsection{Clustering \& Dimensionality Reduction}

A common way to find structure in complex high-variate data sets is by performing dimensionality reduction.
Many dimensionality reduction techniques are available in the R package ecosystem.
We demonstrate the use of dimensionality reduction techniques by providing a wrapper around principal component analysis (PCA).
The application allows for selecting variables on which PCA is to be performed, and the number of principal components to be added to the parallel coordinates.
Adding principal components to the parallel coordinates allows the user to link the more abstract principal components to concrete variables.
In Fig. \ref{fig:paco-analytics}, we can see for example that the first principal component is correlated to weight, displacement and economy (negatively).

Another common task in exploratory analysis is clustering in order to find groups of similar data items.
Like with dimensionality reduction, the R package ecosystem provides a number of clustering techniques.
We demonstrate the use of clustering techniques by providing a wrapper around K-means clustering.
The application allows for selecting variables on which the clustering is to be performed and the number of clusters that have to be returned.
In Fig. \ref{fig:paco-analytics}, we can see for example that the a clustering with 5 clusters captures quite well the structure found in the first principal component.

\section{Rendering}
In order to keep the system responsive even for large datasets, our system supports WebGL where available. Using hardware-accelerated graphics greatly improves rendering speed over canvas- or SVG-based rendering and allows for the use of custom shaders to implement advanced rendering techniques for parallel coordinates such as progressive rendering~\cite{heinrich_progressive_2011} and continuous parallel coordinates~\cite{heinrich_continuous_2009}.

\subsection{Continuous Parallel Coordinates}
Overplotting is one of the main challenges with parallel coordinates: The view quickly becomes cluttered as the datasets grow. One possible clutter-reduction method is to compute and render the \emph{density} of lines instead of individual lines. By using \emph{line-kernels}, this approach is the same as computing a kernel-density estimate for histograms or scatterplots. Figure~\ref{fig:density} shows an example of a continuous parallel-coordinates plot with Gaussian kernels.

\subsection{Progressive Rendering}
Our implementation supports progressive rendering. Here, the plot is updated after a number of lines or kernels have been processed in order to show the user an intermediate result. Hence, the image is \emph{progressively} evolving towards the final result. This is particularly useful if aggregation techniques such as continuous parallel coordinates are employed, as the dominating patterns are likely to appear early in the process. 

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{pollen_opaque}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{pollen_density}
  \caption{\label{fig:density}In large datasets, important patterns may be obscured by the dominating feature. In this example, the envelope of lines in the top image suggests a Gaussian distribution for the data. The kernel-density estimate shown in the bottom image reveals the peak density hinting at a hidden cluster of lines.}
